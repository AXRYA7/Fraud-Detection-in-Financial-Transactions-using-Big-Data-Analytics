# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions using Big Data Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
Financial institutions process large volumes of transaction data daily, making manual fraud detection impractical. This project implements a scalable fraud detection framework that leverages Big Data analytics and machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent financial transactions efficiently.

## Objective
To design and implement a scalable fraud detection system capable of processing large-scale transaction data using Apache Spark and classifying transactions as fraudulent or genuine using machine learning models.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Apache Spark (PySpark)  
- Spark MLlib  
- VS Code  
- GitHub  

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Records:** ~280,000 transactions  
- **Nature:** Highly imbalanced dataset representing real-world fraud scenarios  

## Big Data Concepts Applied
- Distributed and parallel data processing  
- In-memory computation using Apache Spark  
- Scalable machine learning pipelines  
- Handling class imbalance in fraud detection datasets
